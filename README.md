# EECS590_mini_project2
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for Mini Project 2, which extends the abstract Markov Process and Markov Reward Process framework to full Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It focuses on modeling, solving, and analyzing sequential decision-making problems using value functions, Q-values, and dynamic programming methods.
